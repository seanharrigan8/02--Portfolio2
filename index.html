                <p>
                Hello! My name is Sean Harrigan and I'm an English teacher based in the vibrant city of Chicago. I have a passion for languages and literature, and I love sharing this passion with my students every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to dive into the world of programming and learn how to build websites and applications. I believe that the skills I will gain from this boot camp will not only open up new career opportunities for me, but also enhance my abilities as an educator.
                
                    I'm always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
                </p>
                <p>
                   This was my about me but don't worry, it'll only get more exciting as time goes on. </p>
